ARCHIVE CONTENTS

The data contained in this archive are the final version of GPWv3, and
should be used instead of the previous (alpha, beta) versions.

This archive contains population counts, both UN-adjusted and unadjusted, 
in ASCII format. The raster data are at 2.5 arc-minutes resolution and contain 
the following data:

p90g	population counts in 1990, unadjusted
p90ag	population counts in 1990, adjusted to match UN totals
p95g	population counts in 1995, unadjusted
p95ag	population counts in 1995, adjusted to match UN totals
p00g	population counts in 2000, unadjusted
p00ag	population counts in 2000, adjusted to match UN totals

The ASCII format stores the data as simple text. The first lines
of the file give the resolution, number of rows and columns, no data 
value, and rotation factors.

The data are stored in geographic coordinates of decimal degrees based 
on the World Geodetic System spheroid of 1984 (WGS84).
